# IS515 Notebook Running Instructions

To get started with the IS515 project, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Codespace

Click the button below to create a Codespace for the `fall23_is515` branch:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/idaks/Logic_Programming_Playground/tree/fall23_is515)

**Note:** After initiating Codespace, wait for the `postCreateCommand` to complete in the terminal. Meanwhile, use the shortcut `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on Mac (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` on Windows) and select `View Creation Log` to monitor the setup progress.

### 2. Launch Jupyter Lab

Once the `postCreateCommand` has finished, start Jupyter Lab by entering the following command in the terminal:

```bash
@username -> /workspaces/Logic_Programming_Playground (fall23_is515) $ jupyter lab
```
If the terminal becomes unresponsive or blank after executing jupyter lab, simply refresh your browser. This should reveal the Jupyter Lab URL.

### 3. Access Jupyter Lab
Copy and paste the URL into your browser, or Command-click (Mac) / Ctrl-click (Windows) the link directly. If prompted for a password or token, use the token XXX from the URL:
```
http://localhost:8888/lab?token=XXXX
```
This should grant you access to Jupyter Lab where you can begin your work.
